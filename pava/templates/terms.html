The Service is available online through the Website (and also through our software mobile application). The Service performs a daily scan of statements for credit card accounts, bank accounts and other financial accounts specified by the user (the <b>“User Accounts”</b>) to monitor for potential unwanted and unauthorized charges such as hidden fees, billing errors, forgotten subscriptions, scams and fraud. Users of the Service also are provided with information and reports regarding potentially questionable transactions identified by the Service, including (i) access to an online dashboard through which the user is provided a consolidated view of its User Account statements, with information and analysis regarding potentially questionable transactions identified by the Service, (ii) monthly scan reports and (iii) email alerts of potentially questionable transactions identified by the Service.</li>
				<li>Pava currently offers two different Service packages to its users: (i) the <b>“Free Account”</b> Service offering is made available to users at no charge and covers monitoring of two (2) of the user’s financial accounts; and (ii) the <b>“Paid Account”</b> Service offering is made available to users for a fee and covers monitoring of three (3) or more of the user’s financial accounts. Please see our Pricing Terms and Conditions for more details.  Our Pricing Terms and Conditions are incorporated into these Terms by reference.</li>
